/**
 * This class manages the camera's view matrix based on user input. It does not manage the perspective matrix
 * @author tapple
 *
 * Camera is on a rig as follows:
 * origin: The point the camera rotates around
 * offset: a vector from the origin to the ideal camera, in camera-local coordinates
 * transitionRail: a vector the camera animates along when changing from one origin to another. It runs from the ideal camera to the actual camera
 * 
 * baseOrientation: the orientation before the device orientation is taken into account. This is animated inertially in response to swipes
 * deviceOrientation: the current orientation of the phone
 * baseDeviceOrientation: the orientation of the phone at which the camera is at its base orientation
